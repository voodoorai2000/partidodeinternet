= Pickler

Synchronize user stories in Pivotal Tracker with Cucumber features.

If you aren't using Cucumber, you can still use pickler as a Pivotal Tracker
command line client, provided you humor it with a features/ directory
containing a tracker.yml file.

== Getting started

  gem install tpope-pickler --source=http://gems.github.com
  echo "api_token: ..."  > ~/.tracker.yml
  echo "project_id: ..." > ~/my/app/features/tracker.yml
  echo "ssl: [true|false]" >> ~/my/app/features/tracker.yml
  pickler --help

"ssl" defaults to false if not configured in the yml file.

For details about the Pivotal Tracker API, including where to find your API
token and project id, see http://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/api .

The pull and push commands map the story's name into the "Feature: ..." line
and the story's description with an additional two space indent into the
feature's body.  Keep this in mind when entering stories into Pivotal Tracker.

== Usage

  pickler pull

Download all well formed stories to the features/ directory.

  pickler push

Upload all features with a tracker url in a comment on the first line.

  pickler search <query>

List all stories matching the given query.

  pickler start <story>

Pull a given feature and change its state to started.

  pickler finish <story>

Push a given feature and change its state to finished.

  pickler --help

Full list of commands.

  pickler <command> --help

Further help for a given command.

== Disclaimer

No warranties, expressed or implied.

Notably, the push and pull commands are quite happy to blindly clobber
features if so instructed.  Pivotal Tracker has a history to recover things
server side.
